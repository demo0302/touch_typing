This Python project offers a simple typing speed test tool designed to measure a user's typing speed and accuracy. Built using Python's time module and string manipulation, the program prompts users with a random sentence and records the time taken and errors made while they replicate the prompt. The tool calculates typing speed in words per minute (wpm) and tracks errors based on word-level differences between the provided text and the user's input.

Key Features:

Random sentence generation for diverse typing exercises.
Accurate calculation of typing speed in wpm considering time taken.
Error tracking based on word-level comparison for precise assessment.
User-friendly command-line interface facilitating easy testing.
Usage:

Users are presented with a random sentence to type.
After completing the typing exercise, the tool calculates typing speed and errors made.
Speed is measured in words per minute, offering insights into typing proficiency.
Errors are tracked based on word differences between the prompt and user input.
Technologies Used: Python, time module, string manipulation.
